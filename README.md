# Yakuza-Blender-Shader-Converter
This script will take the materials imported into blender from a Yakuza map rip and convert them to use Blender's principled shader node.
Yakuza Imported Proprietary Shader to Blender Principled Shader Conversion Script v. 2.0

Just run this script from inside your project and it will find all the matching 
materials and convert them to use principled bsdf instead. Currently it only will convert diffuse and normal maps, without handling compression. If you need it to do more complicated stuff, I can take a crack at it. Just contact me at any of the sources below, (and hopefully I'll see it).

Detailed steps:
Open Blender, and the project that contains the extracted yakuza map.
In the top left, click on Window>Toggle System Console. (so you can see what it's doing.)
Go to the scripting tab, and open up the "ProprietyShaderToPrincipledShader.py" file from there, then hit the run button.
Watch it save you probably days of work.
